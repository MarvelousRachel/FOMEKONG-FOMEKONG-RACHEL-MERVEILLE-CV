          <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in Marine Engineering at Guangdong Ocean University, specializing in underwater robotics, 
            SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), deep learning, and sensor fusion. My research focuses on improving 
            the navigation and perception capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in complex underwater environments.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As a competent and self-driven researcher, I have extensive background in the development of both terrestrial 
            and underwater robots, with practical knowledge of kinematics, motor control, navigation, and localization methods. 
            I am proficient in ROS/ROS2, C++, and Python, with a solid academic background in sensor integration and deep learning.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have successfully implemented various SLAM systems, including ORB-SLAM3 and NICE-SLAM, and have developed 
            point cloud processing pipelines using Open3D and Python. My work includes developing a complete underwater SLAM pipeline 
            integrating advanced techniques like SuperGlue/SuperPoint feature matching, adaptive voxel-based mapping, 
            and water current compensation algorithms.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I am enthusiastic about using state-of-the-art technologies to improve navigation and robotic systems in challenging environments. 
            My goal is to advance robotic autonomy through multi-sensor fusion and underwater navigation, contributing 
            to the field of underwater robotics through innovative approaches that combine traditional techniques with 
            deep learning methods.
